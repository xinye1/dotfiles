# Dotfile collection

My small collection.

Currently this is set up on Manjaro i3, i.e. i3 config is in `$HOME/.i3/` by default, rather than the normal `$HOME/.config/`.

## Dependencies

* dunst
* i3
* i3blocks and i3block-contrib 
* kitty and [themes lib](https://github.com/dexpota/kitty-themes)
* lsd
* picom
* rofi
* zsh, oh-my-zsh and powerlevel10k
* Roboto font
* Nerd Fonts patches (e.g. Caskaydiacove)
* xbacklight
